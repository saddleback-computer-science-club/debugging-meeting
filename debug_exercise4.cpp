/*
DEBUG EXERCISE 4:

Congratulations making it here!

This exercise is meant to be DIY where you can play around with all of the
tools we went over including:
- The built-in debugger
- clang-tidy and clang-format
- valgrind
- Tests

Here's a few ideas for experimentation:
- Dynamically allocate an array in memory and see how valgrind reactsd
- Write some terribly formatted code, maybe everything on the same line,
and see how clang-format changes it
- Write code that attempts to access an element outside the bounds of a 
dynamically allocated array.
- Create some basic algorithms for sorting an array/vector and create unit
tests for them. Try the same with any other algorithms you know!
